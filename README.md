# Flipkart Grid 5.0 - Fruit Shelf Life Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the **Fruit Shelf Life Detection** app built for **Flipkart Grid 5.0**! This innovative Flutter application leverages advanced camera vision technology and machine learning to help users seamlessly capture and organize essential details from a wide range of grocery products, specifically fruits.

Our solution goes beyond simple data capture; it intelligently predicts the shelf life of fruits based on their visual attributes, ensuring that users make informed purchasing decisions.

## Key Features

- **Standalone OCR**: Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on-device without relying on server connections, ensuring speed and reliability.
  
- **Image Capture & Preprocessing**: Effortlessly capture images and enhance their quality using advanced preprocessing techniques to improve text extraction accuracy.
  
- **Text Detection & Segmentation**: Utilize contour detection to isolate text and segment it based on font characteristics for more precise data extraction.
  
- **Structured Data Output**: Transfer extracted raw data to our custom LLama3-70b model, which processes it into a well-organized format for easy access and analysis.

## Freshness Index

Our unique freshness index assesses fruit quality by analyzing key attributes such as shape, color, and texture. This sophisticated approach uses transfer learning with the **Efficient Net** algorithm, allowing us to deliver accurate freshness predictions that inform users about the shelf life of their fruits.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: For a responsive and user-friendly mobile app experience
- **ML Kit**: To integrate powerful machine learning functionalities
- **AWS**: For seamless deployment and storage solutions
